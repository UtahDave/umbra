Umbra
=====

AI is the creation of darkness, functions and logic that exist beyond the
vision and comprehension of human minds. That is what an umbra is, the
darkest spot of a shadow. This is literally the means to create darkness.


Workflow
========

The platform should allow for plugins to be added that create a super simple way
to make AI routines that can be easily reproduced and executed.

The umbra command allows for modules to be executed via the CLI that will
run AI routines that are part of the plugins.

Components
==========

We need to have a few components.

Common Utils
============

Things like basic, reused, data transforms. Like dynamicaly creating
word maps from input data words.

Models
======

A way to create models that can accept high level data and spit back results

Data Managers
=============

A statndard way to express a format of input data and then transform it into
data for a model

Persistence
===========

A system to allow for data structures to be registed so that they become
persistent across executions of the system. Like training data and word maps etc.

Ingress
=======

A system to allow for easily attatching onto inbound data streams and sources

Egress
======

A system used to push findings out once they are found

Generate
========

A place to load up plugins that are used to generate datasets

System Flow
===========

The system should be attatchable from multiple means, but basically the input data
is filtered and then passed to a model which creates egress data.

The whole system should be configurable via yaml/json/toml so that you can specify
input source, data constructs, and putput systems all from configuration
